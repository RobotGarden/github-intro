== What is Git? What is GitHub?

Git is a _revision control system_ that was created in 2005
to support the Linux
project, replacing an earlier non-free, commercial system. It is designed
to be fast, simple, free, and to support parallel development by many
distributed developers. In addition, it supports both small and very
large projects equally well.

GitHub is a cloud-based hosting service since 2007
for Git repositories. It supports
all the features of Git and adds new, web-based features such as issue
tracking and Wikis.

=== Revision Control

A _revision control system_ keeps track of your files over time, retaining
all versions of each file and allowing you to see the history of
changes. You can see what was changed when, and see the details about
exactly what was changed.

In addition, a revision control system acts as an online back of your
files. Cloud-based revision control systems such as GitHub back up
your files on remote servers, aiding in disaster recovery.

=== Other Online Providers Supporting Git

You can use Git with other online hosting providers. Some popular providers are:

* BitBucket--Provided by Atlassian, free for repositories wiht 5 or fewer developers.
* SourceForge--Popular free repository, supports other revision control systems, too.
