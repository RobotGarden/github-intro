. On your local machine, edit the README file, adding this text to the bottom: ...

. Commit the change to your local repository, but do not commit to the remote.
+
_At this point you should see that your local *master* is ahead of the *origin/master* in the commit list._

. On GitHub, edit the README again, adding this to the bottom: ...

. Commit the change on GitHub.

. In SourceTree, fetch remote changes by pressing the fetch button,
image:fetch-button.png[Fetch button, 38, 49], and clicking OK. Or, from the command line, use `git fetch` and then `git status`.
+
_In SourceTree there should be a fork in the development line in the commit list. This is an indication that you must merge. From the command line, `git status` will tell you that the two lines have diverged._

. As you can see in the commit list for the _master_ branch, the two development lines are split. You must merge the changes on the server. Either use the _Pull_ button, or click _Merge_ and then select the commit on the server to merge into your local _Master_. Or, from the command line, use `git merge origin/master`._
+
_You should have gotten a dialog box in SourceTree indicating that there are conflicts._

. Resolve the conflicts and commit.
+
_You can either resolve the conflicts in an editor or, if you have configured an exernal merge tool, launch it by right-clicking on the file in the *Working Copy* view and selecting *Resolve Conflicts > Launch External Merge Tool*._

. Push the changes to the remote on GitHub.
+
_All of *master*, *origin/master*, and *origin/HEAD* should be on the same commit again._
